# Airline Delay Analysis and Hub Impact

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of airline delays using the dataset `aa-delays-2023.csv`. The primary focus is to understand how hub airports influence delays, explore delay patterns, and develop insights that could be useful for predictive modeling.

The analysis includes:
- **Data Exploration:** Understanding the structure of the dataset, identifying missing values, and basic statistics.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features, such as whether an airport is a hub, and categorizing flights based on delays.
- **Data Visualization:** Using plots to examine delay distributions, hub airport impact, and correlations.
- **Predictive Analysis:** Investigating potential machine learning approaches to predict delays.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of airline flight records with multiple variables related to flight schedules and delays. The key attributes include:

### Key Features
- `ORIGIN`: The airport code from where the flight departs.
- `DEST`: The airport code where the flight arrives.
- `ARR_DELAY`: The delay in minutes upon arrival (positive values indicate a delay, negative values indicate early arrivals).
- `DEP_DELAY`: The delay in minutes upon departure.
- `ORIGIN_HUB`: A binary feature indicating whether the departure airport is a hub (1 for hub, 0 for non-hub).
- `DEST_HUB`: A binary feature indicating whether the arrival airport is a hub.

Additionally, the dataset may contain other relevant fields like flight duration, airline codes, and scheduled times.

## Dependencies
To successfully run the notebook, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

The notebook makes use of:
- **NumPy & Pandas:** For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating visualizations to explore the dataset.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For potential machine learning applications in predictive modeling.

## Steps to Run the Notebook
1. **Load the dataset**: Import the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and perform initial exploratory analysis.
2. **Clean and preprocess the data**: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and create new features such as hub classifications.
3. **Explore hub impact**: Identify major hub airports and analyze their influence on flight delays.
4. **Visualize the findings**: Generate various plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to understand delay trends.
5. **Predictive modeling (Optional)**: Explore potential machine learning approaches to predict flight delays based on the extracted features.

## Insights and Findings
- **Hub Airports & Delays:** Hub airports may experience different delay patterns due to congestion and high traffic volume.
- **Departure vs. Arrival Delays:** Strong correlation between departure delays and arrival delaysâ€”delayed departures often lead to delayed arrivals.
- **Responsibility Categorization:** Flights are categorized based on responsibility levels for delays (e.g., airline, weather, airport congestion).
- **Potential for Predictive Modeling:** With sufficient feature engineering, the dataset could be useful for machine learning models to predict delays.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into flight delays, particularly focusing on the impact of major hub airports. By identifying key delay patterns and developing new features, this work serves as a foundation for further predictive modeling efforts. The findings can benefit airlines, airport authorities, and passengers by improving scheduling efficiency and minimizing delays.
